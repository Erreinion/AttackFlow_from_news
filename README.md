# Purpose
These are representations of cyber attacks described from public sources converted to attack flows using the MITRE Attack Flow tool: https://center-for-threat-informed-defense.github.io/attack-flow/builder/

Attack flows created manually, but should be quickly replaced by AI-generated conversions (once a tool exists).

Repo created to aid in cyber tabletop exercise (TTX) scenario creation.
