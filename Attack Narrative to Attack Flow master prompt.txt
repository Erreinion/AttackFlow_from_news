Master Prompt: Evidence-Backed ATT&CK Attack Flow Reconstruction

# Task
Analyse the following article(s) and source material and reconstruct a precise attacker activity flow suitable for direct conversion into a MITRE ATT&CK Attack Flow.

# Methodology and Rigor Requirements
- Treat the source narrative as incomplete by default.
- Cross-reference the article with authoritative secondary sources, including where relevant:
	- Government advisories (CISA, NCSC, NSA, FBI, JPCERT, ENISA)
	- Vendor threat intelligence (Mandiant, Microsoft, CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Unit 42, SentinelOne, etc.)
	- Prior incident reporting for the same actor, campaign, or tooling
- Only include steps that are explicitly stated in sources or strongly supported by multiple corroborating sources.
- Clearly distinguish between:
	- Confirmed behaviour
	- High-confidence inferred behaviour
	- Optional or alternative branches

# Output Structure (Strict)
1-Sentence Attack Flow Summary
- One sentence describing the end-to-end attacker activity in plain language.

End-to-End Attack Flow (MITRE ATT&CK)
- Present the flow as an ordered sequence of attacker activities.
- For each step, include:
	- Tactic (MITRE ATT&CK)
	- Technique / Sub-technique (with ID)
	- Description (what the attacker did, in operational terms)
	- Expert Shortcut (a terse phrase an experienced analyst would recognise)

Example format:
- Tactic: Initial Access
- Technique: Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190)
- Description: Actor exploited an exposed edge service using a known vulnerability to gain unauthenticated access.
- Expert Shortcut: “Edge device CVE abuse”

# Branches and Variants
Where multiple paths are plausible or documented:
- Clearly show branch points (eg Option A / Option B)
- State what evidence supports each branch
- Avoid collapsing variants into a single generic step

# Confidence Notes
For the overall flow and any key steps:
- High / Medium / Low confidence
- Brief justification

# Source Corroboration
- List all sources used
- Indicate which steps are supported by which sources
- Prefer primary and government sources over commentary

# Constraints
- Do not add defensive recommendations or mitigations
- Do not introduce speculative malware or tooling unless sourced
- Keep the focus on attacker behaviour, not impact commentary
- Use precise, professional language suitable for IR, intelligence, or regulator audiences

# Goal
Produce a forensically sound, intelligence-grade attack flow that can be lifted directly into:
- MITRE ATT&CK Flow diagrams
- Incident reports
- Tabletop exercise inject chains
- Threat intelligence briefs
